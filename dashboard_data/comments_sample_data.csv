1ecpc17,Mississippi,lf7zavt,"Ive seen the differences as well and a big one that I can speak to is directly related to mental health and quality of life 

I take a couple of medications that are classified as controlled substances Ive been on these medications for about 6 years now When I moved to this area from out west I suddenly came up on roadblocks in getting these prescriptions filled even though I have a comprehensive record of medication compliance as in I literally have a binder of my medical records including lab results 

Basically the MS DEA has strict limits on when certain prescriptions can be refilled So if I have a medical emergency and need a little more of my medication I then run the risk of running out at the end of the month 

Ive also had issues with being treated like a pillshopper mostly when trying to find new medical providers when I first moved out here 

Where I lived before I was treated like an adult who knew how to manage their health and their life 

Out here theres definitely a sense of government doesnt trust you to manage your own health so were gonna do it for youby limiting reasonable access to your medication

And its not just MS My partner works for a major university in LA in their Dept of Public Health and the state is doing away with a program that deals with rehabilitation programs for folks addicted to opiates 

And some people might think good those degenerates dont need help they need to be jailed Exceptone of the results of the program closure is that folks in recovery will no longer to have access to medical specialists They all will now have to go to a GP further adding a burden to practices that simply may not yet have staff experienced enough with drug addiction treatment protocols

1ck4jkw,Florida,l2mfhiq,"Got news for you  If it really was all the new roofs that supposedly swept over Florida like a tsunami  ask yourself this question  
If scam roofers and easy bait homeowners truly are to blame for all the steroidinfused insurance premiums   
Why didnt the state regulators stop this by scrutinizing when the roofers pulled building permits 


They havent had that problem when discouraging verified voters Zapinstant election integrity office 

How about street protests and riot enforcement Zapwe had an instant Florida Militia They sold it to the public as disaster assistance  but if you paid attention to the volunteers training stories  that didnt quite match up They were clearly trained for conflict violence handtohand war tactics  

If you read through a lot of what happened in the Special Sessions and the previous Florida insurance officer that rolled back consumer rights at least 100 years  right before he disappeared Note that none of the damage he created for the insured has been restored  Read that part again  Its bad enough with unaffordable escalated costs Even worse are the rights that almost all property owners arent even aware of that they have lost

But theres more Insurance rights of 1924 multiple layers of unfathomable priceswhat else could there be

In the December Special Session they accepted 81M yes  as a gift from the collective insurance industry  Now that could have helped a lot of people lower annual premiums  However  our unfaithful FL leaders had other plans  It was only for their campaign war chests Of course 

Everyone got what they wanted while we were assigned the task of paying for it Insurance companies could increase premiums and cut coverage knowing that consumer rights were severely restricted  And now they were allowed to be ghost writers of those trimmed down state regulations  Campaigns were flush with donations 
Then why arent we happy too 

My point is that you are being served a raw deal if you believe the entire problem is about free roofs and hurricanes  

In fact  theres other layers of this sordid plot that are even more unfriendly to FL consumers Follow the news off the beaten path read further into multiple news productions of the same event These are not in the glaring headlines or soundbites The Florida insurance and Governors office would prefer that you skipped over these pesky details to enjoy the sunshine",2024-05-05T00:31:42+00:00,45,Ok-Understanding5124,Negative,0.6345742,0.3443388,0.021087013,"('environment and natural resources', 'transportation and infrastructure')",0.253144995,"['environment and natural resources', 'transportation and infrastructure']",comments_sample

1aojhkq,Texas,kq5oyjs,"That bar is way too high for anyone to clear like saying a person can burn a cross on their neighbors lawn but so long as they dont selfidentify as a racist theyre not racist in your book But lets take a look at what Abbott has done to stem gun violence following the 7 mass shootings that have occurred under his watch By the way thats 7 mass shootings in about 8 years in his state while whole countries have had zero in that timeframe 

In 2016 a year after the second Fort Hood shooting Abbott made it legal to open carry handguns 

In 2017 following the Dallas police shooting where law enforcement said the new open carry law was making their job more difficult especially during an active shooter event Abbott forced universities to allow people to carry concealed firearms in all areas of college campuses 

In 2019 following three more mass shootings including one in a high school and one in a Walmart Abbott held roundtable discussions about the shootings and although many ideas were discussed there was very little followthrough Only a statewide active shooter alert system and making it a state crime to lie on background check forms came from these talks 

Later in 2019 following another mass shooting Abbott removed the cap on the number of school liaison officers who could carry firearms adding additional firearms to school shooting events 

Also in 2019 he made it legal to carry firearms in places of worship Do not let the irony pass you by on that one 

In 2021 Abbott made permitless carry legal allowing anyone 21 to carry a firearm in public without a license or training 

Also in 2021 he made Texas a 2nd Amendment Sanctuary State promising to shield Texans from having to immediately follow any new federal gun control laws 

And more recently he doubled down on gun rights limiting the powers the state can do to control gun sales during an emergency and made it legal to carry guns into hotels 

So as another person pointed out his actions certainly tell a story Hes certainly made it easier for killers to shoot people",2024-02-12T23:43:48+00:00,1,acastleofcards,Negative,0.730861,0.25680703,0.012331933,"('crime and law enforcement', 'government operations and politics', 'immigration and civil rights')",0.247994536,"['crime and law enforcement', 'government operations and politics', 'immigration and civil rights']",comments_sample

What Im not for is if a guy who is transitioning to a girl has gone through male puberty Wants to play in sports Thats an unfair advantage because biologically and scientifically MALES are stronger and faster This is not sexist and its not just humans this is throughout the animal kingdom which we are part of

If dressing up is the opposite gender of what you were born makes you happy who am I to say no to that its your life and it doesnt affect me at all 

But I dont believe in this they them gender fluid Want a male but I dont consider myself a male I identify as Stuff 

I am a Democrat btw

If you were born with a uterus and a vagina And can give birth and get boobs at puberty you are a female Period 

You decide that you consider yourself the opposite gender thats fine with me Do what makes you happy 

But lets stop putting in all these pronouns and crap And then getting mad at people for not knowing what your pronouns are If you have penis between your legs youre a dude So Im going to say hey man

It also specifically uses unitary executive theory which is essentially full control over executive branch no idependence from DOJ FTC FCC As well as a myriad of other things 

While a typical president may not have power to enact their policy without support from legislative body A project 2025 conservative will have that type of power 

And even pretending its a pipe dream and project 2025 was not a super serious game plan There is a myriad of attacks already under way that affect states 

Such as attacking service members ability to access reproductive care As well as attacking use of federal funding for it as well as organizations that use it has been a common non stop way to attack the issue Long before states rights which fyi if were following history ITS NEVER been about state rights All the way back to slavery the first thing when they did when seceding was make it illegal for states to outlaw slavery

1cfztmy,Virginia,l1ttkd4,"Conflict broke out in the 1920s and 30s because of the Balfour Declaration 

Jews have always been in the Levant 

They have been there coexisting with Muslims and Christians since it was the land of Canaan before it became Palestine 

Before Britain claimed it as a colony 

Not all land purchases were legal and you know that you just conveniently gloss over that fact

You completely ignore that in 1948 BenGurion  declared all of the land to be Israel and sanctioned the removal of Palestinians who had lived there for generations You conveniently neglect to mention the forced removal of entire communities from their land just so Jews from Europe and America who never lived there who had no ancestral ties to the land could move in  How in the 1950s entire groves of Olive trees some centuries old were destroyed by Israelis to force the Palestinian farmers out 

You want to talk history you need to talk about the horrors perpetuated on people already living there when outsiders decided the land was theirs and no others  

You need to mention how the Israeli government  has labeled Palestinians as animals and claims the land was empty and unclaimed   How Palestinians  are forced to stay in Gaza stripped of any rights outside of the strip how they are forced to jump through major government enforced hoops just to  to get a work permit that allows them to leave briefly 

The Partition itself was horrific and still has ramifications to this day 

But no other splitting of a country has led to the atrocities that are currently going on in Gaza Israel and the West Bank except the Partition  Much of which is the fault of the governments involved 

And before you say well the Jews have been persecuted long before Yes the Pale of which I had family emigrate from was an atrocity and yet another stain on human history It even existed long  before the Holocaust 

 The difference between the Pale and Gaza is that the Jews in the Pale up until the late 1930s or so were allowed to leave Palestinians in Gaza are not They are forbidden to leave without a work permit that can be revoked at any time for any reason  They literally have no rights that are recognized  by the Israeli government  

A significant number of Jews in Israel are not free from spewing hate at Christians or Muslims either  While the majority would rather there be peace and be allowed to live with their Palestinian neighbors there is a vocal few that want them all dead 


You want more context more history The internet is available Numerous books on the subject are available   I provided two links in my initial comment there are many more out there Anyone who really cares enough to know can easily click on them and read for themselves 

But what it boils down to is that the governments are to blame not the innocent civilians who just want to live their lives",2024-04-29T19:04:54+00:00,2,WolfSilverOak,Neutral,0.32966673,0.65562063,0.014712645,"('immigration and civil rights', 'national security and international affairs')",0.273343517,"['immigration and civil rights', 'national security and international affairs']",comments_sample

Tbh its not my area of expertise so I defer to medical professionals for that But thats exactly where I think this issue should be decided by a team of medical professionals not politicians 

The physiological difference between men and women are undeniable

This law is directed at minors Hormone blockers would prevent these perceived advantages 

Im also not a fan of implementing these hormonesblockers at such a young age to offset any sort of advantage That seems like a very excuse to give kids HRTblockers tbh

So no HRT until they are 18 By then their bodies have developed enough that passing as the preferred gender wont be possible Also these advantages people are so concerned about height muscle mass would be difficult to reverse muscle mass if not impossible height 

Unless you propose to shut trans adults out of public bathrooms and organized sports completely they need to be allowed to follow medical guidelines for hormone blockers as minors",2024-05-27T19:31:57+00:00,1,Sick_Of__BS,Negative,0.7162835,0.27107522,0.012641268,"('health and healthcare',)",0.24261006,['health and healthcare'],comments_sample

And of course the building codes should require minimal risk construction materials

My favorite example is water damage does anyone have water leak detectors i do and how about ways to minimize the damage in a home ie the drywall goes right to the floor maybe if it was elevated a bit the walls wouldnt be ruined in the event of a flood there are also water monitoring systems  but i think only one that can shut off all your water if it detects a leak no i dont have that yet also the insurance companies are somehow in on it  cause they dont require anything from homeowners to reduce flood risks

She wasnt criminalized for her inability to seek care the prosecutor somewhat reasonably was charging for the inaction of attempting to provide life giving care to the child  Ultimately the grand jury couldnt find their way to bring chargers and thats likely the right decision here

And the Republicans have done nothing They refused to seat a Supreme Court Justice in 2012 with Obama as president because they said it was too close to the election It was 9 months before it Then they pushed the last conservative Justice in 45 weeks before the 2020 election The now conservative Supreme Court made possible the end of the right to an abortion in America They also ruled that a president is immune from criminal prosecution for vague official acts Republicans and Trump will pass a national ban on abortion Are you a woman have a wife or a daughter Right now in states that have the ban maternal mortality rates are skyrocketing And these are many women who are simply having a miscarriage Doctors are too scared to provide them any care for instance if any partial tissue does not pass from a womens body They watch these women get sicker and sicker as they develop infections because they cannot receive a simple procedure to remove this tissue Some die others develop other permanent damage and others can never have any other children They didnt try to have abortions This is not political rhetoric these are FACTS Do some of your own research I implore you to think critically and find out the truth yourself Congratulations on becoming a citizen and welcome I cannot speak to your comment about democrats and what has been done to Brazil but if you care to respond on that I will do my research and respond I know that as a new citizen you were required to study a lot on American history and our government I implore you to just take a few issues that i described and find out the truth for yourself Our current mainstream media have ignored how terrible Trump and the Republicans are until just recently Trump has said he wants to be a dictator on Day 1 and he has also said that after this election his supporters would not need to vote again This means he wants to stay President for life and if he dies his Vice President is ready to follow his plans You now have your right to vote are you ready to give that up God Bless to you too I write this with the hope that some people who are misinformed will consider investigating themselves and this is said with care and compassion",2024-10-10T04:12:47+00:00,2,Sleeplessmi,Neutral,0.057553433,0.8062245,0.13622203,"('education and social services', 'government operations and politics')",0.233231359,"['education and social services', 'government operations and politics']",comments_sample

1bwn99f,NewHampshire,kyc9wrx,"so maybe Im wrong

Well at least you are open to the possibility

Look Im not going to address every point you made Im not trying to insult you when I say this but they are ridiculous It is very obvious you have never genuinely interacted with a trans person and have never made any serious attempt to educate yourself on what gender dysphoria actually is what trans peoples experiences actually are and what transitioning actually entails

We know we are born male  female We are not ignoring biology But biology does not NEED to determine how we live our lives and how we present and interact with the world An obvious example of this is punishing boys for crying or expressing emotion The idea that men cant cry is just a straight up toxic and arbitrary restraint to a man being able to live and fully experience the one life on earth he has

While we do not understand exactly WHY someone is trans or gay for that matter we do know it has to do with the way brains develop while we are in the womb We are neurologically wired to be one sex but our physical bodies develop the other way Leading theories include hormone shifts variance in gene expression between the trimesters missing or altered protein receptors on certain genes among others

What this functionally means for us is that we feel fundamentally deeply uncomfortable in our physical bodies and the gendered expectations of and ways people interact with those bodies

Its impossible for cis people to fully understand how this feels A decent taste of it though is to imagine a woman getting a hormonal issue and starting to grow a beard She would be HORRIFIED and do everything she could to get rid of the beard She would not only feel physical discomfort seeing a beard on her in the mirror very morning but people would judge her harshly for it when she goes out in public too You can imagine a similar scenario if we are talking about a guy  a great example would be gynomastia a condition where teenage boys grow tits It horrifies them and embarrasses them and they often get surgery to fix it and go back to looking more male Because that aligns with their subconscious sense of gender

Trans people experience that but for their entire bodies 247 And they usually are forced to live with it their entire lives until they are old enough to live independently and can afford the often high cost of many medical transition options

Let me be clear its not like cancer It wont directly kill you But it spiritually kills you Seeing your body seemingly mutate further and further away from the person you were supposed to be every day Never being able to truly connect with people or experience life because everything fundamentally feels like a lie Like no one can see who you actually are Just a mask that is permanently sewn on top of your face Its enough to make the suicide rate of untreated trans people as high as it is

When we ask you to do something as simple and easy as gendering us correctly or not deadnaming us we arent talking about gonadalgenitalkaryotypical sex Sex and gender are not the same thing We ask you to call us women Not females

This is not something that is hard for you to do Truly you do it every single day whenever you interact with anyone You dont ask to look in peoples underwear or give them a chromosome test every time you interact with someone You judge based on context clues clothing body shape hair mannerisms etc what their gender is and gender them without even thinking about it

There are some people though where those context clues arent obvious such as masculine looking women who like to dress like dudes trans people who dont pass as their gender trans and cis people who just dont vibe with our cultural stereotypes of how menwomen should act and dress and so choose to be gender nonconforming

I bet if you bumped into a masc looking women in baggy jeans and an oversized sweater and said oh excuse me sir and she said mam actually but no worries dude  youd be like oh shit my bad haha and go on with your day There is no logical reason to act this way with someone you think is cis and not act this way with someone you think is trans Because again gender does not equal sex

Okay Im done rambling haha If you have genuine questions Im happy to try to answer them when I have time If you ask I can also send you some really great peer reviewed resources that explain trans history and experience the science supporting why we should be allowed to transiton why our gender is valid as well as a full explanation of gender vs sex from a biological psychological and sociological perspective

Edit if you dont want to deep dive into a bunch of papers I have two really cool videos that are lretty short

1b4c26a,Utah,ksz1wqa,"I moved here recently from a very progressive area in California that is more than accepting of alternative lifestyles and I havent seen so many transgender people and LGBTQ flags in my entire life here in Utah of all places

Im not sure if its rebelling against the religiosity of the state or what Maybe something in the air or water

Im all for teaching children to be accepting of others and freedom to pursue your life as you see fit as long as you arent harming others but there is something really wrong with indoctrinating young children on these topics in such great detail

Children have vivid imaginations and have yet to truly form their own identities as they are incapable of doing so before they become older It is true that many trans adults knew they were transgender when they were very young 

However there are countless studies showing that desistance rates of children who explore the transgender lifestyle is extremely high I know a young kid who wants to be a mailbox when he grows up Im pretty sure he is going to change his mind some day The vast majority of kids grow out of it during puberty Some become gay or lesbian others are straight However very few end up as transgender when they are adults Ive seen countless debates on the studies that favor both sides of the argument and the studies that show very low desistance rates have serious flaws

Exposing kids to these issues in such depth ultimately leads to more kids exploring these ideas who never would have otherwise One result of this has been that many of these kids end up on pharmaceuticals that have the potential to harm their development and their ability to procreate later in life They end up on various drug cocktails are pressured into surgeries that are not reversible Many of these kids end up regretting their decisions later in life and this can lead to suicide

Let kids be kids Adults can do what they want as long as they arent harming others We can continue to teach acceptance to children however I can totally see where these Republican legislators are coming from I think the progressive community needs to open their mind and look at the other side of the argument on this one because a lot of what they are doing is going way overboard and harming children",2024-03-02T07:24:56+00:00,-18,Secure-Carrot-3176,Neutral,0.10421783,0.5644977,0.33128446,"('culture and recreation', 'immigration and civil rights')",0.247570109,"['culture and recreation', 'immigration and civil rights']",comments_sample

1figypx,WestVirginia,lnmsjc1,"I moved out of WV to go to culinary school in 1998 I spent three years in the MidHudson Valley of NY earning a bachelors with a 5month stint in Key West and a full month in the Bay Area of California during my education I graduated right after 911 and moved back home because all the job offers at resorts restaurants and hotels dried up for most of us thanks to travel restrictions and the general fear that the public had regarding terrorism  From there I moved to Snowshoe and spent two full years working at one of the best restaurants to ever exist before leaving the resort to pursue life elsewhere starting in Baltimore and eventually settling down in the DC area where Ive remained ever since 

When I first left WV for college I didnt miss it at all I grew up in Charleston and the topographical situation climate and general once booming now on the decline feel of the PoughkeepsieHyde Park area matched Charleston and still does Id argue that PoTown is worse off than Charlie West at this point so there wasnt a lot of longing there My time in Key West was an absolute baller party fueled by underage drinking and long hours on the job so no homesickness there and the month traveling around the Bay Area eating great food and drinking wine all day for credit hours to boot was simply one giant party as well 

I began to miss WV more and more when I moved to the DC area Baltimore sucked but I was still young It was only when I started settling in and settling down in the DC region that I started to yearn for my home It was always tough going back to Charleston It was still very much on the decline from the early 2000s until only recently and it was very very visible as something else had changed closed or been torn down every time I went back What I missed were my two years in the mountains of the eastern highlands 

Waking up in the cold foggy mornings of the Elk and Greenbrier watersheds the silence the solitude of winter nights when the falling snow dampened all sound Clear cold water tumbling down rocky river beds with red spruce covering the hillsides shading out all but the most intense light of extra sunny days The Heisler and Shay steam whistles echoing off the hillsides of the Greenbrier River Valley when taking a quiet ride on the trail or kayaking after a particularly good rain in the spring Having Gaudineer Knob and the Shavers Fork all to myself for multiple days never seeing another soul and feeling like the only human left in the world These things are what I miss the most even to this day 

My wife is from NC She grew up there to parents born in NJ Her favorite place in the world was Asheville until she came to WV with me to visit She knows so much about the state now and spends so much time with me there that folks often forget shes not from there Shes come to love WV even for all its faults and is as much a Mountaineer as anyone born and raised there When we were looking for a place to get married we looked all over VA MD even up into PA I took her to Smokeys on the Gorge at what was then Class VI in Fayetteville after she made a comment about how she loved the feel of the openair pavilion at the shooting club at The Homestead one of our options for the wedding but the pavilion only had enough space for the rehearsal dinner She immediately fell in love with the campus there on the New River Gorge and we were married there one week after Bridge Day in 2009

  
We most recently visited early this summer We spent a few nights in Canaan at Black Bear a favorite of ours for shorter getaways and then the balance of the week with my folks back in Charleston This time Charleston hit differently I didnt have the same feeling about it that I have had for nearly two decades Things seemed to be stabilizing and getting better I know I could sell my house here in the DC Suburbs of Maryland and buy something in South Hills outright with the profit Id make My son could go to good schools and there are good jobs to be had if you know where to look I was very tempted when a position that I could have taken and wouldnt have been too much of a drop in pay taking the cost of living into consideration came up at UC The difficulty would have been finding work for my wife since there are few private schools in the area She could certainly take her talents to another industry quite easily but it would be a shift in paradigms that shes not looking to take on at the moment 

I still keep my eye on Zillow for homes in S Hills Thats where I was raised and as I said the schools are still good Ive seen what big cities and the rest of the world have to offer Charlestons not a bad place to be or to be from for that matter and honestly most of the folks around here send their kids to WV schools once they graduate from the MD public school system There are more Flying WV logos on the backs of cars and trucks in Montgomery County MD than youd ever think youd see outside of WV

Why What makes me an idiot I thought it was okay to share perspective as we all areand I can prove of course am not a robot and I dont think we need to lower standards to resorting to calling people names or basing others view points on their intellectual capacity and capabilities How am I an idiot and how does a viewpoint definedictate ones intellect or intelligence and if not then an idiot in what way And by the way if it has anything to do with that of difference of opinion or political views specifically each of these people every single one of them was at one time or another quite literally subjectively and objectively and proven so listed as in by name and label and also by own actions as that of DemocraticDemocratLiberal
In time we may all put any all differences aside and agree to disagree and or unify and not point fingers and solve and resolve any all differencesbiasesassumptionslabels misunderstandings and recognizing things for what they are and little by little save eachother and our own selves and the people and ask for and seek and bring forth change and call out responsibly and reasonably or not the certain specific concerns and circumstances within that of the systems and the ones in control and the at times evil elites
Also we may all sometimes either find common ground and commonalities or at the very least treat ourselves and eachother and others how we would and want to be treated and not how either narcissists or abusers of any kind would be nor let alone that of evil certain elites such as war mongers etc

1fu47mq,Minnesota,lq0h3rx,"When the US sneezes Canada catches a cold 

Despite what many of my fellow Canadians will claim Canada and the US are far more alike than different  We share the same culture similar geography and have deeply intertwined economies The only real difference is population As such even minor events in the US will ripple up to Canada as we are so dependent on the US economy and conversely major disruptions to Canadas resource production will have an impact on the US because the US economy is just as dependent on our resources  A change in government in Canada has zero impact on the US but a change in government in the US will have a massive impact on us  

Trump was bad for Canada particularly in terms of international relations  Canada has always relied on strong relationships with either the US or the UK to exert influence on the foreign stage and Trump effectively sidelined us most of the time with legitimate criticism like failure to meet our NATO obligations and tendency to harbour war criminals  This has continued under Biden who clearly sees our current leader as poison to the voters they are trying to covet 

Long story short when you live in a country immediately adjacent to the worlds dominant superpower it behooves one to pay attention to whats going on because you know good or bad its on the horizon for you and your country as well Trump is likely the reason our government won the last election  enough antitrump sentiment was applied to the Canadian conservatives despite them being left of the US democrats to cause them to win the popular vote but lose the election due to vote splitting in the east mainly Toronto and the Maritimes   This despite the fact that the current governing party is the most unpopular in modern history and the current leader among the most scandalridden and disliked",2024-10-02T18:09:24+00:00,0,cah29692,Neutral,0.09098111,0.7229974,0.18602142,"('environment and natural resources', 'government operations and politics', 'national security and international affairs')",0.253229268,"['environment and natural resources', 'government operations and politics', 'national security and international affairs']",comments_sample

Worse you seem to think that my comment was directed at the inability of a single person to leave a safe distance It wasnt If everyone did it the need to slow down would stop being a problem The fact that its a problem with MOST drivers doesnt mean its not the root cause of the traffic headaches

People move into the gap and the gap stretches to accommodate Rinse and repeat Its a pretty basic theory It doesnt matter how much traffic there is

The issue with failing to do it is that people cant easily merge from one lane to the next when they need to So they slow down in an effort not to miss their target or exit or to avoid getting forced onto the shoulder of a lane merge or whatever They keep slowing down because that future event is just getting closer and they cant get over

Then they stop Then everyone behind them stops Then everyone in the adjoining lane slows down as people in the stopped lane try to force themselves over into the moving lane until it stops and so on

In America we have a culture AND education problem when it comes to driving We really dont teach many people HOW to drive well More importantly we have a society of rugged individualists who dont consider or care how their behaviors affect the rest of the traffic",2024-01-01T15:38:22+00:00,7,hkusp45css,Negative,0.80376583,0.18239117,0.013843067,"('transportation and infrastructure',)",0.202048857,['transportation and infrastructure'],comments_sample

The money came from federal relief funds so there was not much of a direct burden  association on ND citizens

The first and second hearings addressed a serial issue  wells that had been orphaned for extended periods of time that in general no longer had a responsible party hence orphaned

A strong example was the WC KOSHMAN well It was drilled in the 1950s The guys who own  Grand Junction Subs and an arcade bar in Bismarck also bought this well worked it over and reported production by cleaning it out and selling any oil they recovered Then they sold it to a guy in Jamestown as an investment showing an average production of 35bbls oil a day even though all of the production came from a single cleanout The newest owner couldnt figure out why the pump would run but no oil was produced and didnt have the money to find out

The worst part There was no transfer of operator for this well The name Prairie Production was passed from one owner to another and the state couldnt do a thing about it

I would argue for higher bond requirements for oil  gas wells to save the state from a continuing issue Maybe even some kind of blanket operator insurance policy to operate oil  gas wells in the state at all In the meantime we need  needed a stopgap and this was a great opportunity",2024-10-03T22:39:59+00:00,6,Humpp_,Positive,0.026848888,0.3691925,0.6039586,"('economy and finance', 'environment and natural resources', 'transportation and infrastructure')",0.248255766,"['economy and finance', 'environment and natural resources', 'transportation and infrastructure']",comments_sample

1g1s47g,SouthDakota,lrmfj38,"Actually it was under Biden that it happened It was within the last 35 years Judge RBG even noted it wasnt about womens rights but doctors The states never secured a womans right this in Congress never fought for or introduced a federal change I agree that it should be a womans choice But again all that RvW did was make it a federal issue Overturning RvW just made it a state issue again

What we are seeing is the will of the states Some states have already made it legal some havent because either no law introduced to vote in yet or the people in that state dont want it via majority

My criticism of Roe is that it seemed to have stopped the momentum on the side of change Ginsburg said She wouldve preferred that abortion rights be secured more gradually in a process that included state legislatures and the courts she added Ginsburg also was troubled that the focus on Roe was on a right to privacy rather than womens rights

Roe isnt really about the womans choice is it Ginsburg said Its about the doctors freedom to practiceit wasnt womancentered it was physiciancentered Ruth Bader Ginsburg

He essentially did what he did out of sheer nihilism and hearing him articulate it gives you the sense that this will happen again and again as long as our culture fails to provide opportunities for teens and young people to find meaning in their lives

Also based on my own experience with antidepressants and other psychiatric drugs I think in this particular case they were part of the problem They caused diminished emotional range and emotional blunting essentially anesthetizing him to the reality of what he was doing What he did was not the result of delusional thinking or rage It was literally meant to be a statement that nothing matters and that our cultural norms around protecting children are not rational

1d4ew5f,NewYork,l7s8plo,"There is no underlying crime that isnt being charged what are you even trying to say with this

Its almost as if you know nothing at all about this case Donald Trump is NOT being charged with election interference in any court of law in the United States of America He was charged with falsifying business records period 

This is like saying you are charging someone with falsifying business records to cover up a murder without ever getting fucking charged anywhere for the murder itself 

 Merchan gave the jurors three possible unlawful means they can apply to Trumps charges falsifying other business records breaking the Federal Election Campaign Act or submitting false information on a tax return

So which one of those three crimes was he actually charged with The answer is ZERO 

 Also as you can see in the quote the instructions applied to things Trump WAS charged for contrary to your bullshit statement

Where When 

 Please stop just saying its a misdemeanor I already explained that its only a misdemeanor if he was charged with second degree fraud but he was charged with first which is a felony Trump violated state law by using unlawful means to promote his election

But he has not been charged with violating state law by using unlawful means to promote his election in any court of law in the united states of America He was ONLY charged with falsifying business records How can thus possibly be so confusing for you

 Unless you are deceiving voters by withholding information that would have otherwise been made public much less if you are suppressing that information using illegal methods Which is what Trump did and was charged with

Paying hush money is not a crime Period Which is why he has never been charged for it and never will be 

 Trump violated state law by using unlawful means to promote his election then violated state law again by committing business fraud to cover up the previous crime making his charge of fraud first degree So the charge didnt become a felony magically but rather through Trumps criminal actions and nature

But he has never been charged with using unlawful means to promote an election first because that is not a fucking crime and second because he has never been charged with that crime anywhere ever 

You could make the argument that it was an FEC violation which is what Hillary Clinton paid a fine for but it is not a fucking criminal offense let alone a felony 

Do you seriously not understand that Trump was ONLY charged for falsifying business records That the supposed crimes that Bragg used to magically turn this into a felony for the first time in legal history Trump has never been charges with in any court of law in the land 

 Trump was indicted on March 30 2023 more than six years after the earliest charge in the indictment which dates to Feb 14 2017 Thats beyond the five years typically allowed by the statute of limitations but theres a catch Former New York Gov Andrew Cuomo extended the time limit to file charges in all criminal cases when courts were disrupted by the COVID19 pandemic in 2020 From an article published by USAToday

Lol They literally changed the law to put their political opponent in jail and youre using this as evidence that it wasnt a politically motivated prosecution



 Mr Bragg who served as a chief deputy at the New York attorney generals office when it sued Mr Trumps charity in 2018 said it was critical in politically charged cases to ignore the public pressure

 When you do the right thing for the right reason in the right way justice is its own reward he said You cant be motivated by public passions You have to be rooted in the facts

Lol 






Heres Harvard law professor emeritus Hillary and Biden voter and lifelong liberal Allen Dershowitz Were supposed to listen to the experts right  

 Never in American history has anyone ever been prosecuted for  as Trumps defense argued was the case  erroneous bookkeeping made by a company underling who failed to disclose the payment of hush money

 What there is plenty of precedent for is the payment of hush money

 Since the 1790s when Alexander Hamilton paid to keep his adulterous affair secret many such payments have been made by politicians across the spectrum

 And of course none of these will have been disclosed on corporate forms  which would defeat the point of keeping something secret  and no one has ever been prosecuted for failing to make such a disclosure

 The infamous conversation between Stalin and the head of his KGB Lavrenty Beria is often quoted Show me the man and I will find you the crime

 This prosecution was even worse because though DA Bragg tried desperately to find a crime with which to charge Trump he failed to find one as did his predecessor Cyrus Vance

 So Bragg went a dangerous step further than Stalin ever did he made up a crime

 He found a misdemeanor that was past the statute of limitations  making a false bookkeeping entry on a corporate form  and magically converted it to a felony that was within the limitation period by alleging that the false entry was intended to cover up another crime

 Throughout the trial many people inferred that crime to be an alleged attempt at election interference But Bragg never actually explicitly stated that

 In fact the prosecution didnt tell the court what Trumps other crimes were until their closing arguments on Wednesday  by which point the defense had no opportunity to respond

 And even then the supposed crimes outlined were vague

 In his closing instructions Judge Juan Merchan exposed his already apparent bias once more  telling the jurors that they didnt actually have to agree on the specifics of Trumps unlawful behavior",2024-06-09T07:05:13+00:00,1,_antkibbutz,Negative,0.7217582,0.26006675,0.018175045,"('crime and law enforcement', 'government operations and politics')",0.237688834,"['crime and law enforcement', 'government operations and politics']",comments_sample

Officials should never ever be authorized to excuse anything within 3 degree of their seat or office Its corruption 101 Pardons I like to think in general are a massive loophole installed as a PR function To say that a Governor or president can swoop in and pardon some one or grant a stay of execution in extreme cases its just good PR when used right But these days one side delivers pardons like a magic act just for entertainment while the other uses them to get their buddies and loyal supporters out of jail 

Any one with half a brain knows how destructive Citizens united was Corporations are not people But then again no one with a brain voted for thing It was really installed to work around campaign laws designed to limit donations and force transparency Now we have SuperPACs

OK thats your opinion But thats a political idea not history and while you can teach it to your kids do so on your own dime Dont spend my tax money on it 

In fact it is implicitly racist because denying the reality of systemic racism would require the belief that minorities are generally delusional liars 

Then how do you explain the fact that not every minority is on board with CRT Certainly not Indian Americans who have an average income of over 100k per year BTW this might totally blow your mind  but white people ARE a minority worldwide 

White supremacy was a bedrock of the nation for so long that key institutions incorporated it into their DNA Even in the Civil Rights Act era that evil is showing its effects which are negative for everyone including white people 

I fully understand thats what CRT contends But I see very few actual examples of this And why only in white nations Do Asian or African countries incorporate their own supremacy into their DNA

Nuff said 

 They can only get a permit if you legalize a secondary market

No idea what leads you to this conclusion You think parking permits are granted for life

 Crucially this is different from ticketscalping in that an individual cant get more than one permit

Yeah and bots cant buy tickets

 To take another example the people who persuaded the New York city government to create the Taxi Medallion system were rent seeking Those who circulate those taxi medallions now are not rent seeking

The taxi medallion system was designed to avoid tragedy of the commons and to provide a living wage for drivers instead of having a race to the bottom Allowing anyone to get more than one medallion was a problem and the city indulged it corruptly because it gave them revenue

Parking permits would be sold They would require renewal They would require documentation to prove you are a resident They would hopefully either ban cars above a certain lengthweight or charge them a lot more to encourage smaller cars

1gddkhw,Idaho,luqzhww,"I dont consume much media at all anymore ive processed through the  the way i think and how id like to apply history and morality to the ethical system i seem to have and hold ideas to those standards as i consider them I find a lot of mainstream stuff either side unwatchablebut thats generally because i view them as degrees of conservitive For me Biden is  pretty much bushera conservitive apart from a few social issues

And i dont think all conservative ideas are conspiracys its just that many of them  have little to no substance beyond that

The bathroom thing for example I can agree with all of your points the safety the rates etc but then if i ask you how did this country exist for 235 years without those laws and this never once become an issue and before the successful allowance of the previous scary social thing gay marriage conservatives never even brought this up Its so rare so infrequent that there may be a tiny handful of examples a yearif that of it ever coming up Fineit happens right a few times a year

I can apply logic to itno mediais sexual assault still a crime Yes Then why does going to the bathroom have to be a crime Is peeing inherently criminal No Is it a human right Well by god it should be lets jam it there under the 9th amendment Sodo we have the right of a reasonable expectation of privacy is a public bathroom Yes Can we translate that to your point of safteyyes Then shouldnt we give the reasonable expectation of privacy and saftey to the trans person to not be assulted investigated and criminalized for  their 9th amedment right of being able to use a bathroom I think so Because the assault is still criminal if it should happen

Theres just no logical reason whatsoever to ban something that went without a ban for over 200 years and remains unbanned in most states to this daywithout issue

Because if i did what you didand thought of this right of safety in the way that we ban the existing of the person who has the potential of commiting an assault but 99999 of the time wont ever in their entire lifetimeto the idea of a school shooting which might be more common that trans people assaulting women in bathrooms tbh then by your logical pattern we should criminalize gun ownership I KNOW you dont agree to that but thats the logical path youd have to takeand i dont agree with banning guns either for the same lefty pathing to this decision i have on the bathrooms

The healthcare thing is strange Idaho makes it so 12 year olds can prohibit their parents from having access to their healthcare records and decisions Thats thats a good law actually I like the idea of people having personal autonomy in making decisions as early as  maybe half of them reasonably can be expected to I think its absurd that a government is removing the right of both the parent and the child how the republicans are writing the laws of making healthcare choices and expressing autonomy The same way likely that you feel that its absurd that you have to be 21 to buy a pistol but can buy long guns at 18 Autonomy that doesnt harm others should have the least amount or regulation on it as possible

Thats being leftist

The thing about being rightor conservative is that its nearly never about expanding or enabling rights You use the weight of the law to prevent social change and the expansion of rights Thats where the conspiracy comes inand its not that all conservatives are conspiracy holders or all ideas are its that the justifications that most use to arrive at conclusions to get to conservative ideas involve that type of thinking The fearmongering around the immigration debate on the right the coming to take your jobs is simultaneous with eating all the welfare funds and tossing  in replace American family valueswith WHATfamily values As if they dont have families

So when were forcedleft dems etcto confront having to hear conservatives explain conservative ideas they seem like a  theyre trolling like theyre as unserious as the people who say conspiracy theory things and dont believe them

Thats back to hat i said it doesnt seem like they can be serious because theyre not basing these things on evidence or systems of consistent logic etc Or even studieswe love studies ya know And they happen all over the world and most show that in nearly every way possible most conservitive social and economic ideas just dont work They end up looking unserious to us How can they not know how wrong they are

The memes look like theyre intentionally trolling their base its odd

Their self interest will become self evident

 Democracy has always been under  attack because it directly threatens the very lucrative business models of dictators and autocrats

It has just sped up by the Information Age

A corrupt judge or politician in 1960 had to worry about a borough Maybe a state  But in the average 2030 year career he could get away with it and someone  would do a documentary 30 years after his death when they finally put the pieces together

Now we have Russian oligarchs that eviscerated the Russian middle class by stealing and consuming everything of value in the 80s and 90s  By 93 they were running out of things to monopolize and extort 

Soviet corruption ate itself to death 

The survival of their Kleptocratic species required new feeding grounds which they found in New York  Giuliani was willing to show them preferential treatment by redirecting NYPD resources onto the Italian mob which gave the Russian mob in their nice new suits a ripe hunting ground

Ironically ecologists figured this out about the same time in Yellowstone



Only difference is that most humans are the elk Just wanting a safe place to sleep healthy happy kids and an opportunity to survive

Its a very small percentage of humans that are sociopaths and psychopaths without the ability to empath but over a long enough centralization of the good humans moving to cities and paying taxes it becomes too tempting of a feeding grounds So the worst of us rise to the top and become CEOs bankers and presidents because its the lowest effort model Why go hunting when the prey delivers itself to you

A psychopath has no personal qualms about trafficking a child for sexual slavery or stealing a pension fund They are neurochemically unable to

We are just in the late stages of it now More centralized than we have ever been in known human history with commerce and business happening 247 across every time zone  This causes their respective corruption models to start overlapping

Guiliani was Americas mayor when he cleaned up New York  but only because the Russians were quiet about their part in it  The money laundering and narcotics and human trafficking they were doing through Ukraine was a million miles away from studio 54 or Times Square

But now kyiv is in the news every day  Its inevitable that their obfuscation starts breaking down

For 50 years the inmates ran the asylum in soviet Russia They stole everything of value including the hope and future of Russians

The corruption eventually collapsed the Soviet Union and they were forced to expand their feeding grounds The billionaire oligarchs moved to Aspen and London and left the hollowed out husk of Russia behind where 1 in 5 people have never seen a flushing toilet 

In 89 the wall falls and for a couple years they hid all their ill gotten gains under a mattress until they moved and bought condos at trump towers

They made stops in ukraine cyprus and London but they landed in New York because that was what everyone wanted in 1993

Levis Pepsi Madonna tapes that werent smuggled bootleg copies 

They all bought new suits and cars and changed their title from most violent rapist street thug in moscow to respectable Russian oligarch but they didnt leave their human trafficking narcotics or extortion behind  It was their most lucrative business model

Trump and Giuliani just opened the doors and let the predators in to feed

Guiliani redirected NYPD resources away from their Russian allies intentionally and onto the Italian mob  It let him claim he cleaned up New York and it lets the russians a perk of doing business with trump His client and coconspirator

The insane valuations coming out in trumps fraud trial are a necessity of the money laundering cycle that duetschebank was doing with the Russians 

Justin Kennedy supreme court Justice kennedys son was trumps inside man at duetschebank that was getting all of his toxic loans approved 

If their plan goes through it is basically the 2008 mortgage crisis on steroids

I see you mention Eminent domain which is necessary sometimes but problematic at times I mean it sounds ok but essentially the state just insists on taking peoples land Then the state builds and eats the costs In the past folks called those the projects Those housing projects tended to be problematic We need to improve and learn lessons from the past Extremely high density projects do not provide much quality of living unless other improvements are made in concert with the housing Sadly that means costs go up I am not against this per se but I am not about to pretend you can easily build 500 two bedroom apartments for 80k each and bam were Vienna 

I would support eminent domain in cases of foreign ownership a program of forced buyback of especially undeveloped or underdeveloped properties owned by foreign entities 

The problems in this country wont go away for a few generations IF and only If we address and provide legit mental health care and services for EVERYONE from elementary school on and we address income inequality with Basic Income programs

Fyi much of Europe and the creators of the Dutch model have done a 180 on puberty blockers and child treatment
Puberty blockers were only FDA approved for precocious puberty
This application is offlabel and necessarily damages bone density brain development

In particular there is a troubling indifference to gay children being converted by their parents

If a male child is given puberty blockers according to the American schedule generally starting at 10 they will never be capable of orgasm Additionally there will not be enough penile tissue to successfully invert into sexual reassignment surgery
They are flying blind and ignore all dissent as transphobia
The overwhelming majority of adult trans women do not get sexual reassignment surgery which is perfectly understandable It is reasonable to assume a functional penis is meaningful

Hes a pedo goes without saying the prisoners will give him what deserves in prison

That is not to say that there arent people in the LGBTQ community that arent predators Every people group in the world has fucked up monsters like that however this guy and those like him are often the people screaming the loudest about kids are being sexualized and call for books to banned etc So the fact that he was arrested for being a Pedo draws more scrutiny He was arrested for the very same crime he was essentially accusing the LGBTQ community for

The overall reason for the generalities is because this seems to happen incredibly often with those on the political Right They often seem to accuse others of the very crimes they themselves commit Am I saying those on the left are innocent No Im not but they arent the ones trying to take peoples rights away while breaking the laws they wish to enforce on the rest of us",2024-03-22T13:58:32+00:00,9,Mikazuki072,Negative,0.85716367,0.1353914,0.007444944,"('crime and law enforcement', 'culture and recreation', 'immigration and civil rights')",0.263623924,"['crime and law enforcement', 'culture and recreation', 'immigration and civil rights']",comments_sample
